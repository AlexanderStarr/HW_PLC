Notes
-----

- These homeworks uses Agda, see **install-notes.txt** for information on how to install Agda.  The assignments also rely on a library written by the professor, referenced in **install-notes.txt**, which can be found at [this URL](https://svn.divms.uiowa.edu/repos/clc/class/111-spring14).
- Assignments 5, 6, and 7 use a tool written by the professor called **gratr**.  See **gratr-notes.txt** for information on obtaining this tool.
- Many assignments start with a file provided by the instructor.  This is usually referenced in the accompanying assignment sheet, and the original file should be accessible as the oldest version of the file in the repository history.
