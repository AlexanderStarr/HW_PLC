The notes below are based on my experience installing Agda on a
Windows 7 computer.  The process on Windows 8 is likely very similar,
though I have not tried this.  These are the very detailed,
step-by-step notes.

You can likely skip all that and install Agda very easily by just
downloading and installing these MSIs, in order:

http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~astump/agda/Haskell2013.2.0.0.v1.msi
http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~astump/agda/Emacs_for_Agda24.3.v1.msi
http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~astump/agda/Agda2.3.2.2.msi

Then you just need to follow step 16 below, to add some extra commands
to your .emacs file.  These MSIs have been confirmed to work on
Windows 7 and Windows 8.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Installing Agda and emacs

0. FIRST TRY DOWNLOADING AND RUNNING THE INSTALLERS ABOVE.  IT WILL
   BE MUCH EASIER THAN FOLLOWING THE DETAILED STEPS BELOW.  

1. Download the Haskell Platform for Windows from 

   http://www.haskell.org/platform/

   and run the installer.  Haskell wants to install
   itself to C:\Program Files (x86)\Haskell Platform\2013.2.0.0 
   This should be fine.

   The installer will also ask you want kind of installation you want.
   The "standard" installation is fine.

   Once the installer finishes, it will ask you if you want to install
   GLUT on your computer.  GLUT is a Haskell library for doing
   graphics with Open GL.  We will not be using GLUT, so you can
   decline the installation of GLUT.

2. Open a Windows command shell from the Start Menu, by typing "cmd" in
   the box which lets you search for files and programs, and hitting enter.

3. From the Windows command shell, first run

     cabal update

   Next run 

     cabal install Agda

   This 'cabal' program is a package manager for Haskell.  Running
   'cabal install Agda' will download the Agda source code from 
   hackage.haskell.org, a central server where Haskell libraries
   and programs are posted.  Cabal will also download compile and 
   additional Haskell packages needed by Agda.

4. Download emacs version 24.3 from 

     http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/

   The file is at the bottom of the page:

     emacs-24.3-bin-i386.zip

   This is currently the latest version, although the specific version
   likely does not matter too much.

5. When the download is complete, extract the downloaded .zip file, 
   by right-clicking on it, and choosing "Extract All...".  As the
   destination for emacs, I chose

     C:\Program Files (x86)

   The extraction process will create a folder emacs-24.3 in that
   directory.

6. When the extraction process has completed, navigate to 

     C:\Program Files (x86)\emacs-24.3\bin

   and double-click on the addpm program.  This program will
   add emacs to the Start menu.

7. To complete the installation of the Agda emacs mode, we must
   next add emacs to the Windows path.  To do this, right-click
   on the icon for your computer within Windows Explorer, and
   select Properties.  Then click "Advanced system settings".
   This will pop up yet another window, with the Advanced
   tab highlighted.  Click on "Environment Variables...", and
   then request to edit the PATH variable.  In the text box
   for the PATH variable, append ";C:\Program Files (x86)\emacs-24.3\bin"
   (including the semicolon) to whatever text you see there (if
   blank, you presumably do not need the semicolon).

8. Close your existing Windows command shell, and start a new
   one (as in Step 2 above).  This is to refresh the PATH
   variable now that we have changed it (Step 7).

9. From the new Windows command shell, run 

     agda-mode setup

   This should finish almost instantly, with a message
   saying something about "Setup done. Try to (re)start
   Emacs..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
II. Installing extra fonts and configuring Agda

10. We need to install some extra (free) fonts for Agda to show Unicode
    more nicely.  Go to 

    http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page

    and click the "download" link in roughly the middle of the page.
 
11. From the new page that comes up, select "2.34/dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.34.zip"
    from the list of download options.

12. When the download completes, open the .zip file by double-clicking
    on it from Windows Explorer.  Navigate to the dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.34\ttf
    subdirectory.

13. Double-click on "DejaVuSans".  This will pull up a font viewer window.

14. Click on "Install".  This will install the DejaVuSans font on your
    computer.

15. We need to tell emacs to use the new font.  To do this, run emacs
    (you can just select it from the Start menu), and then type

    Control-x Control-f

    This is the emacs "open file" command.  A little text box will 
    appear at the very bottom of the emacs window.  Type

    ~/.emacs

    into that text box, and hit enter.  This will open your .emacs
    file, a file that the emacs program processes for your user settings,
    every time emacs starts up.

16. At the very start of your .emacs file, cut and paste the contents 
    of the following file:

    https://svn.divms.uiowa.edu/repos/clc/class/111-spring14/emacs-extras.el

    In the text you are cutting and pasting from that file, change YOUR-PATH
    to the directory path which leads to the 111-spring14 directory
    you installed.  Use forward slashes in the path.  So YOUR-PATH might
    be Users/YourName/Documents.

    You also should add the following text to your .emacs file:

    (set-default-font "-outline-DejaVu Sans-normal-normal-normal-sans-*-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")

    This will prevent you from having to set the default font every time
    you start emacs.  I did not include this in emacs-extras.el, because
    on the CS lab machines, the code to set the default font is already 
    included in a global configuration file.

17. Select "Save" from the file menu, or just type 

    Control-x Control-s

18. Quit emacs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Testing Agda

19. We need to get some sample Agda files to complete the
    configuration and testing.  You can do this by checking out the
    class repository using svn, following the directions here:

	https://svn.divms.uiowa.edu/repos/clc/class/111-spring14/installing-and-using-svn.txt

    You can then find a sample Agda file in 111-spring14/lib/bool.agda.

20. Right-click on the file and choose "Open".  You will get a list of
    programs that does not include Emacs.  Tell Windows that you want
    to select the program to use from your locally installed programs.
    You will get a window showing a bunch of programs, not including
    Emacs.  Select "Browse..." and then navigate to 

    C:\Program Files (x86)\emacs-24.3\bin

    and select "runemacs" from the list.  Then click "Ok".

21. You will return to the list of programs, but now emacs will be
    listed.  Select it (if not already selected), and tell Windows
    you always want to open files of this type (.agda) with this
    program (emacs).  Click "ok".

22. Emacs should now open with bool.agda.  

23. You should see a file with characters including ùîπ.  If you see
    weird squares with numbers in them, something has gone wrong
    with the font installation.

24. Now type Control-c Control-l.  This tells emacs to ask Agda to
    process the file.  If this works, the text in the bool.agda file
    should get colored with different colors.

25. To complete the testing of Agda, open the file
    111-spring14\dev\install-test.agda, either from within emacs,
    or else by double-clicking that file in Windows Explorer.

26. Type Control-c Control-l.  If you see an error message saying 
    something about "cannot find file lib.agda", then there is
    a problem configuring emacs, back in Step 16, so that it knows
    about the class's standard library (which is in 111-spring14\lib).

27. Agda installation, configuration, and testing is now complete!
    You have Agda on Windows, with extra fonts and the class's
    standard library.
