Notes:
- Graphviz files will be dumped out for each snapshot.  They will be titled "memX.gv", where X is the number of the snapshot.
- Compile these files to PDF format by using the following command: "dot -Tpdf -o memX.pdf memX.txt".
- Roots are hidden nodes, and cells can take on a somewhat strange orientation.
